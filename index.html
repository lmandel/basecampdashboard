    <h1>Basecamp Issue Dashboard</h1>
    <div id="chart_div" class="mainChart"></div>
    <p>The basecamp burndown chart includes issue information gathered from Bugzilla and Github.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Total Scope = All issues flagged as blocking-basecamp+ (open+closed)</li>
    	<li>Open = All open blocking-basecamp+ issues in Bugzilla+Github</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The burndown chart provides a view into the current state of the project scope and open issues.
    The "Open" data represents the work that is left until v1 of basecamp will be considered complete.
    This line alone is not enough to demonstrate the work of the project team. The current open count
    needs to be viewed in relation to the total scope, which represents the incoming issue rate.</p>
    <p>As basecamp progresses towards the v1 release, the expectation is that the total scope will
    flatten out (as there are fewer incoming issues). At this point the open count should start to 
    decrease more rapidly as we progress through the shutdown phase of the project.</p>
